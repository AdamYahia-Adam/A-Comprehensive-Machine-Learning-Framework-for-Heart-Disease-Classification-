# A Comprehensive Machine Learning Framework for Heart-Disease Classification-
This project develops a machine learning framework for classifying heart disease outcomes using a clinical dataset of 920 patient records and fifteen diagnostic features. The framework evaluates a range of models — including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, TabNet, and a shallow neural network — to provide a balanced comparison between traditional, ensemble, and deep learning approaches.
Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, with gradient boosting methods delivering the strongest results; CatBoost achieved the most consistent overall performance. Feature importance and SHAP analysis were used to interpret model behaviour and identify key risk indicators such as age, chest pain type, cholesterol level, and maximum heart rate.
The project demonstrates how advanced machine learning models can support clinical decision-making and offers a reproducible framework for future research in medical predictive analytics using structured clinical data.
